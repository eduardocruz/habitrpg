# What's This?

I'm consolidating @litenull's rewrite branch with the old code, and removing files from both sources once they've been
successfully merged into the new platform. While @litenull's "from scratch" approach was really clean, it will take
us longer to implemente all the original features. This approach will (1) let us leverage code we already have, (2) merge
in litenull's hard work from the last few weeks.

Once this archive/ directory is completely empty, we should be fully merged and ready to deploy the rewrite!
